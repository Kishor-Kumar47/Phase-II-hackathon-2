# Prompt History Record: Generate tasks for todo app

## Files Modified
 - specs/002-full-stack-todo/tasks.md

## Tests Run
 - none

## Prompt Text
```

```

## Response Text
Generated comprehensive task list for the full-stack Todo application with authentication based on the design documents. The tasks are organized into five phases: Setup (T001-T004), Foundational (T005-T014), User Story 1 - Public Landing Page (T015-T022), User Story 2 - User Authentication (T023-T036), and User Story 3 - Todo Management (T037-T050), plus a final polish phase (T051-T059). Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, parallelism markers, story labels, and specific file paths. The tasks align with constitutional requirements for React/Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, JWT authentication, and red/black color theme.

## Outcome
Successfully created a complete task list that follows all required formatting and organization principles.

## Evaluation
The task list is properly structured by user story priority, follows the required format, includes all necessary components from the design documents, and maintains independence between user stories for parallel development.
